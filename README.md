# Discord-Bot
<b> Final project for Introduction to Problem solving and Programming in Python </b> <br />
Video showing off the program: https://youtu.be/bI9ZB5zixKE/ <br />
<b>Overview: </b>

Writing the code for the Discord bot wasn't inherently challenging until we incorportated websites into the commands. In order to create a proper image search command, you need a website that you can take images from.
My first issue I ran into was figuring out how to use a private api in my program. I didn't successfully do that, however, I found a much simpler website that didn't require a private api and I used Aiohttp to get the images.
Another issue Mia Dubac and I experienced was that the Discord bot would not run unless it was on my PC. Even after whitelisting her as a developer on the Discord Portal, she still wasn't able to compile her code to see if it worked.
The only way we were able to get around this issue is if Mia would send me her code and I would troubleshoot it.
Overall, the issues I encountered were mainly because of my lack of knowledge in programming. However, Mia and I were able to get around these issues by finding simpler solutions.
