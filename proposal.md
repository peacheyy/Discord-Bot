# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Discord Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A bot that replies to commands in Discord.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will create a bot that joins our Discord server. It's features will consist of replies to chats, replies to commands, search engine functionality will also be included. We will be writing the code in Python on Visual Studio Code. There is a whole library made for Discord bots which we will import into our code.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be where the bot is functionable and can at least reply to messages in the server. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be where the user can play games with the bot in addition to the reply functionality.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be where the bot is able to pull pictures from the internet through a search program.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills that will be needed are the ability to incorporate the internet into our code, as well as understanding the Discord bot libary. We will be researching the Discord bot wiki. We will most likely just code on one computer and figure out it together.
